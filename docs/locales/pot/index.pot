msgid "**Pipenv** is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. *Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world.*"

#: ../../index.rst:25
msgid "It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your ``Pipfile`` as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important ``Pipfile.lock``, which is used to produce deterministic builds."

msgid "Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment. For the distinction between libraries and applications and the usage of ``setup.py`` vs ``Pipfile`` to define dependencies, see :ref:`pipfile-vs-setuppy`."

msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:38
msgid "Managing a ``requirements.txt`` file `can be problematic <https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/a-better-pip-workflow>`_, so Pipenv uses ``Pipfile`` and ``Pipfile.lock`` to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination."
