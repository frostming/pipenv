msgid "You might also want to add ``--ignore-pipfile`` to ``pipenv install``, as to not accidentally modify the lock-file on each test run. This causes Pipenv to ignore changes to the ``Pipfile`` and (more importantly) prevents it from adding the current environment to ``Pipfile.lock``. This might be important as the current environment (i.e. the virtualenv provisioned by tox) will usually contain the current project (which may or may not be desired) and additional dependencies from ``tox``'s ``deps`` directive. The initial provisioning may alternatively be disabled by adding ``skip_install = True`` to tox.ini."

The ``Pipfile`` is a convenience for you to create that lock-file, in that it allows you to still remain somewhat vague about the exact version of a dependency to be used.
